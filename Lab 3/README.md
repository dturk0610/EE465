## My Approach

This lab served as an introduction to 3D transformations using matrix math. The topics explored and showcased are rotations using Euler angels (though I may explore the possibility of using quaternions sometime soon), translation-or movement-using basic offsetting and finally scaling. Each of these matricies will be shown below in the order that they appear in the code. On top of this, their execution order will also be the same.

Scale Matrix:
 'mat 4x4{[ scaleX,      0,      0, 0 ],
         [      0, scaleY,      0, 0 ],
         [      0,      0, scaleZ, 0 ],
         [      0,      0,      0, 1 ]};'

Scale Matrix:
mat 4x4{[ scaleX,      0,      0, 0 ],
        [      0, scaleY,      0, 0 ],
        [      0,      0, scaleZ, 0 ],
        [      0,      0,      0, 1 ]};
